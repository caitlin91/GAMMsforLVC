# GAMMsforLVC
If you're not familiar with Github you don't need to learn for this workshop - just click on the Green "Code" button and click "Download Zip". 
Repository of data and code for the GAMMs for LVC workshop at Newcastle University on 28th February 2025

Please see the "GAMMsforLVC_Introduction" pdf for expectations and reading.

Everything you'll need for setup will be here by Thursday morning but I will update slides and notebooks till the day of the workshop so you will need to pull/redownload again on Friday.
